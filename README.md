## Installation

To run the Java code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Java SE 8 or later is recommended.
    - You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
2. **Git** - To clone the repository.
    - Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Text Editor** (Optional) - Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code are recommended.

### How to Check if Java is Installed

To check if Java is installed on your system, open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type:

```bash
java -version
```
You should see a version number if Java is installed.

## How to Clone
**To clone this repository to your local machine, run the following command**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
## Running the Java Files
**Once you have cloned the repository and navigated to the project directory, you can run the `Java files` using the following steps**
  1. Compile the Java file:

```java
javac filename.java
```
  2. Run the compiled Java file:

```java
java filename
```

## Example

```java
javac LinkedListExample.java
java LinkedListExample
```

## Topics Covered
- **Backtracking :** Algorithms that involve searching and generating solutions recursively by trying different possibilities.
- **LinkedList :** Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists, including common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **ArrayList :** Implementation and manipulation of dynamic arrays.
- **Trees :** Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs :** Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and other graph-related algorithms.
- **Sorting Algorithms :** Quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, and others.
- **Dynamic Programming :** Problems that involve solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a new algorithm or data structure to add, feel free to fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Please ensure that your code is well-documented and includes test cases.
