## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Java SE 8 or later is recommended for running the Java files in this repository.
    - Download the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) or install [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/), a free and open-source implementation.
2. **Git** - Version control system to clone this repository.
    - Get Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. **IDE or Text Editor** (Optional) - An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a text editor like Visual Studio Code can enhance your coding experience.

### Verify Java Installation

To check if Java is installed and to verify the version, open your terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run:

```bash
java -version
```
You should see a version number if Java is installed.

## Topics Covered
This repository covers a broad range of data structures and algorithms, including:
- **Backtracking :**  Explore recursive solutions for complex problems by systematically searching for solutions.
- **LinkedList :** Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists with various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **ArrayList :** Dynamic arrays with support for random access, resizing, and efficient element management.
- **Trees :** Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs :** Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and other graph-related algorithms.
- **Sorting Algorithms :** Quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort, and others.
- **Dynamic Programming :** Problems that involve solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
